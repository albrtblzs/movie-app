This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Overview

I developed a movie web application. The application is capable of searching, paginating, and displaying the selected movie in a dialog. Moreover, there is a cache handler on the backend limited to two minutes. On the client side, the user receives notifications via a "react-hot-toast" (e.g., data from cache or API, error messages). Exceptionally, I have left the required environment variable in the .env.example to check the local version, but the application has already been deployed on Vercel.

## Future improvements

In the future, more tests are needed for all the components to achieve full coverage. Furthermore, need to modify the layout to get a better UI/UX experience

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
